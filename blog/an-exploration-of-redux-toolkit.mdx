# Redux Toolkit: An exploration

I have never liked unnecessary complexity. It's either that, or the fact that
complexity scares me. I believe that to be testament to the kind of values I hold
especially regarding facing challenges.

Redux and Redux Toolkit have always looked daunting to me. I wondered why it was
necessary and why I had to learn them. Truth be told, as much as I wanted to be
entrenched in the React ecosystem, I didn't want to touch those technologies.

I know, feels impossible but that's genuinely how I felt.
